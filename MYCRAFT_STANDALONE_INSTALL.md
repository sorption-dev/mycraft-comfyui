# Mycraft UI (standalone)

This article relates to the standalone version of Mycraft UI available at https://mycraft.zashifrovano.com/mycraft as simple frontend user interface for your ComfyUI instance.

### Mycraft provides a limitless storyboard experience for image generation, powered by the ComfyUI API.

- Each container functions as an independent ComfyUI workflow.
- Supports workflows (text-to-text) and fine-tuning (image-to-image).
- Supports [workflow customization](./CUSTOM_WORKFLOWS.md).


## 1. Install required Custom Nodes 

The Mycraft UI uses the following custom nodes to enhance the user experience:

- [rgthree-comfy](https://github.com/rgthree/rgthree-comfy.git) (for the [Power Lora Loader](https://github.com/rgthree/rgthree-comfy?tab=readme-ov-file#power-lora-loader)).
- [Impact Pack](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Impact-Pack) (for the [Switch Latent legacy](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Impact-Pack?tab=readme-ov-file#switch-nodes) and [Concat Conditionings](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Impact-Pack?tab=readme-ov-file#etc-nodes)).
- [ComfyUI-load-image-from-url](https://github.com/tsogzark/ComfyUI-load-image-from-url) (is using for img2img).
